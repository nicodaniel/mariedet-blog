                        I'm french and I live in Paris. I like to ride to places, which inspire me no matter far or close.
                        Cycling for me, is in a way, the melting pot of things I like. It's exercise, being outdoors, meeting new people, travelling and doing races. I have seen places and met people that I would never have if it werenâ€™t for the bike. Cycling push me to be better every time. I like to climb mountains passes around the world, I think I'm an addict to climb up mountains because it's pushed me to go beyond my limit and I like it.
