Since 2019 I use to train with the home trainer WAHOO KICKR CORE. For me, it’s the best home trainer regarding the price and the quality. It’s really easy to use (very important for me ahah) and with ZWIFT it’s the perfect combo for a perfect performance indoor training. 
KICKR CORE delivers a realistic and quiet indoor training experience by using the proven flywheel technology, advanced algorithms, and integrated cadence measurement that originated with the iconic KICKR smart trainer.
Tips : buy a ANT+ key for a better connection with your home trainer, it’s faster that Bluetooth. 
You just need to buy a cassette and you are ready to rock and roll.
