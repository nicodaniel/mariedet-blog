100% made in Italy 

 

In December 2019, I received a new bike from Basso Bikes : the new Diamante disc Opal white.  Just in time for Christmas! 
The color of my Basso Bike is magic, color changes depending of the light. 
It’s an amazing bike for climbing and going downhill it’s just insane. It’s so fast, stable and comfortable in the same time. I didn’t know that a fast bike could be so comfortableI love the way it looks and the way it feels. I love all the details with the little Italian’s flag. I love the smooth. 
Since my crash 6 years ago with a car in downhill, I’m a little scared, and with the disc brake it’s really better for me. I feel safer and I’m a little bit faster in downhill.
