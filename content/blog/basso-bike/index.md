**BASSO Bikes : 100% made in Italy** 

In December 2019, I received a new bike from the brand BASSO Bikes, based in the north of Italy. I have the new Diamante disc Opal white. 

The color of my Basso Bike is magic, the color changes depending of the light, sometimes it looks grey, light blue or white. It’s an amazing bike for climbing and going downhill it’s just insane. It’s so fast, stable and comfortable in the same time. I didn’t know that a fast bike could be so comfortable. \
I love the way it looks and the way it feels. I love all the details with the little Italian’s flag. I love the smooth.  \
Since my crash 6 years ago with a car in downhill, I’m a little bit scared, and with the disc brake it’s really better for me. I feel safer and I’m a little bit faster in downhill.
