I'm riding a Basso Bike and I would like to present you Joshua Riddle who is working for Basso Bikes. 

**I know you are American and live in Italy, what lead you to go there ?**

Its a long story so I will tell you the condesned version. After traveling around latin America for sports and studies I did a degree in Spanish literature in Sevilla, after returning to the USA to finish my other two degrees I applied for a scholarship to do my masters in Spain (Valencia) after completing it I looked for work in Spain as I wanted to put my newly gained academic and language skills to the test and see if I could make them work for me in the professional world. I looked in Spain and found a job in Italyâ€¦ strangely enough! I took it and never looked back! Initially it was just for the adventure and challenge but I quickly fell in love with the culture, territoryâ€¦and foodðŸ˜Š

**How long have you been riding bikes and what is your background profile ?**

I always have loved cycling but during my youth I was a track runner and soccer playerâ€¦.and the coaching staff would never allow for cycling as it was thought to be an uncomplimentary movementâ€¦not good for the motor skills of either of the two sports I practiced. However, during the summer months I would ride and during the season I would always be in the bike shop chekcing out all the latest gear and talking about the sport. Fast forward to my move to Italy, I wasnt running track anymore and found myself in what is arguably the epicenter of the cycling worldâ€¦and I was able to finally dedicate some serious energy to cycling. From then forward it has been a constant in my lifeâ€¦6 days a week in the saddle and working with cycling all through the week.

**What your job in BassoBikes consist in ?**

I am the marketing director here at STAR DUE groupâ€¦ we own both Basso and also a MTB brand LEE COUGAN. I am in charge of the communication and promotion of both brands. Anything from press relations to social media to events falls on top of my desk. My team and I try to keep both brands in the forefront of cyclistâ€™s minds across the world. As a marketer working for Basso is a fantastic roleâ€¦because there is a fantastic story behind the brand that rings true even today. It is authentic and telling an authentic story is a fantastic, fun and exciting feeling as you do it in complete honesty. An italian brand, made in Italy, by a family, by the same family since the brandâ€™s birth! Great no?

**Which routes is a must-see in your area and which climb do you like the most ?**

We have so many fantastic routes hereâ€¦ from the Valdobbiadene region that produces Prosecco and its rolling hills to the longer sustained climbs nearby we have it all. perhaps the most famous route near our office is the Monte Grappaâ€¦which has 10 different ways to the topâ€¦some fun other extremly difficult.

**As we are in quarantine, what do you do to stay in shape ? Home trainer ? Strength ?**

During the lockdown it was all Zwift and home gym activities. Now, thankfully we can start riding outside, although only alone, so I have started training outside but also in the gym.
